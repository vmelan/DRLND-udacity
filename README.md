This repository contains project files for Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program

## Projects

### Reinforcement Learning
>[P0_Taxi](https://github.com/vmelan/DRLND-udacity/tree/master/p0_taxi-v2)
For this project, we use OpenAI Gym Taxi-v2 environment to design an algorithm to teach a taxi agent to navigate a small gridworld using Reinforcement Learning methods.

### Navigation
>[P1_Navigation](https://github.com/vmelan/DRLND-udacity/tree/master/p1_navigation)

For this project, we train an agent to navigate and collect bananas in a large, square world using Deep Q-Network (DQN).

### Continuous Control 
>[P2_Continuous Control](https://github.com/vmelan/DRLND-udacity/tree/master/p2_continuous_control)

For this project, we train a double-jointed arm agent to follow a target location using Deeo Distributed Policy
Gradient (DDPG).

### Collaboration and Competition
>[P3_Collaboration Competition](https://github.com/vmelan/DRLND-udacity/tree/master/p3_collab_compet)

For this project, we train a pair of agents to play tennis using DDPG with shared replay buffer.
